## Overview:<br>
Inspired by Noita and the Falling Everything Engine, I am replicating the engine in order to create a survival game.<br><br>
It’s vaguely like Terraria in that it’s a 2d side view survival.<br>
It’s more like Noita with its simulated physics, but less “chaotic”, since dying is somewhat more impactful.<br><br>
One of the main things is that I don’t want it to get stale like other survival games where there’s a fixed progression and repetitive world generation and items you have to craft to progress. I want it to be very procedurally generated.<br>
